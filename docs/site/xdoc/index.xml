        <h1>Overview</h1>

        <h2>Why the Client Container</h2>
        <p>
            In the Single Page Application pattern, different applications will be available from the same entry point.
            A management of the resources (E.g libraries) is required when the user moves from one application to
            another. Also, the container improves usability of the UI providing support in the case of a Not Found
            application.
        </p>

        <h2>What is the Client Container?</h2>
        <p>
            The client container is the runtime container for client apps. It is the implementation of
            the Single Page Application pattern so it has the only index.html. All OSS apps are loaded by the container
            and the container is responsible for managing their lifecycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The client container also provides some common services to apps including logout and a help menu, as well as animation when switching between apps.

        <h2>Who is this for ?</h2>
        <p>The Client Container will fit your needs if you want to deploy many UI SDK applications in the same
            location.
        </p>
