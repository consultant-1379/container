        <h1>System Bar</h1>

        <p>An important feature provided by container is the System Bar - a fixed-height bar on the page top containing Ericsson-branded colored stripe, application title and a set of custom elements.</p>

        <p>Configuration is performed in the file called <code>containerComponents.js</code>, which is located in the root of deployment folder:</p>
<pre>define({
    list: [
        { path: "container/components/HelpButton/HelpButton" },
        { path: "container/components/LogoutButton/LogoutButton" }
    ]
});</pre>
    <p>Each of the entries in the <code>list</code> array contains a single property, <code>path</code>, which defines the location of the System Bar component file relatively to the index.html. Don't include <code>.js</code> extension in the path.</p>

    </body>
